# Computer-Assistant-project1
This project includes a script for Personal Voice Assistant using Python. 
In this the query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need.
The implemented assistant can open up the application (if it’s installed in the system), search Google,
Wikipedia and YouTube about the query, Play mp3 songs, Send an Email, etc by just giving the voice command.
We can process the data as per the need or can add the functionality, depends upon how we code things.
hereWe Google speech recognition API and google text to speech is used for voice input and output respectively.
